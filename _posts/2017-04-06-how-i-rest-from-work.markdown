Having spent my early years in various parts of Maharashtra I have been close to nature all the time. As an ambassador for Pinkathon, I train women at the park near Girgaon beach in South Mumbai. The connection with the trees in the park and the sea shore itself called us to take action towards its maintenance. so, we arranged regular beach clean ups. We also did a couple of clean up treks at the mountain peaks, where we noticed the plastic litter at places out of our reach, same with the beaches.  Then the realization of a bigger force arose.  We need mechanized power to firstly undo those mistakes. And create awareness about disposing the waste responsibly. It has to begin right from childhood education. 
 So, we created Sea fins, where it’s a collective effort by volunteers who are from various backgrounds joining us for the clean ups and creating awareness.  “Ecopurple’ is another group of trekkers for cleaning trekking spots. 
We live at Malabar hill-Mumbai which is quiet green compared to other parts of Mumbai. However, some new construction projects of high rise towers are worry some in this CRZ area. I’ve witnessed The chopping of old huge trees mercilessly in the earlier years. I’m also a part of ‘Savetrees’ organization.
Personally, my husband is an environmentalist who has planted more than 10,000 trees in his private land at the Coastal area of Ratnagiri, Aurangabad and Goa. We strongly believe that saving wetlands and Mangroves will protect life on the land and water.

For sustainability, we need to be conscious and mindful of the resources we use. Theoretically, everyone may be exposed to some sort of sustainability, but our aim is to implement that in our life consistently. ‘Don’t do it if you can’t undo it’. It’s the simplest mantra for any damage we are doing to our planet. Our education system needs to include this subject right from toddlers to get it implemented throughout the life ahead.
